## Methodology Notes

### Budget Categories
The federal budget is organized into 10 major categories for clarity and educational purposes. These align with OMB budget functions but are simplified for public understanding:

1. **Social Security** - Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) + SSI
2. **Medicare** - Federal health insurance for seniors and certain disabled individuals
3. **National Defense** - Department of Defense military operations and personnel
4. **Interest on National Debt** - Net interest payments on federal debt
5. **Healthcare (Non-Medicare)** - Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA subsidies
6. **Veterans Benefits** - VA healthcare, disability compensation, education benefits
7. **Income Security** - SNAP, housing, unemployment, EITC, child tax credits
8. **Education** - Federal student aid, K-12 support, special education
9. **Transportation** - Highways, transit, aviation, rail infrastructure
10. **Everything Else** - All other federal programs and operations

### Subcategory Allocation
Subcategory dollar amounts are based on:
- Official agency budget documents where available
- Pro-rata allocation based on historical spending patterns
- CBO and OMB projections for FY 2024
- Actual outlays reported in FY 2024 year-end financial reports

### Rounding and Precision
- All dollar amounts rounded to nearest billion
- Percentages calculated from exact amounts before rounding
- Subcategory percentages represent share of parent category (not total budget)
- Total percentages adjusted to sum to exactly 100.00%

### Fiscal Year 2024
The U.S. federal fiscal year runs from **October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024**. This data reflects actual outlays (spending) rather than budget authority or appropriations.

### Data Limitations
- Some subcategory breakdowns are estimates based on historical patterns
- Mandatory vs. discretionary spending not separated in this educational tool
- Off-budget spending (e.g., Social Security) included in totals
- Emergency and supplemental appropriations included where enacted
